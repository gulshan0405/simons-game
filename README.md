Description of Simon’s Game
Objective: The primary objective of Simon’s Game is to successfully repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that the game presents. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more complex, increasing the challenge.

Gameplay:

Setup:

Simon’s Game typically consists of a device with four colored buttons (usually red, blue, green, and yellow) that light up in different patterns. Each button is associated with a specific sound.
Game Mechanics:

Sequence Generation: The game starts by lighting up and sounding one of the buttons. This sequence is shown to the player.
Player Response: After the sequence is shown, the player must replicate it by pressing the buttons in the same order. The player must remember the sequence and press the buttons correctly.
Sequence Length: With each successful replication of the sequence, the game adds one more button to the sequence, making it longer and more challenging.
Failure Condition: If the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or pressing buttons in the wrong order, the game typically ends or resets, depending on the version of the game.
Scoring and Feedback:

Success: Successfully repeating the sequence adds to the player's score or advances to the next level.
Failure: Making a mistake usually results in an error sound and/or visual indication. Some versions may display the correct sequence again before resetting.

Visual and Auditory Cues: The game uses both visual (flashing lights) and auditory (sounds) cues to create the sequence, enhancing the memory challenge.
Progressive Difficulty: The game’s difficulty increases as the sequence lengthens, requiring more advanced memory and attention skills.
Simple Controls: The controls are typically straightforward—pressing the colored buttons to match the sequence.
